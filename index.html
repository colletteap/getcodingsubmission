            <div id="bio">
	        <p>I view learning how to code not only as a tool for the growing technology industry in NL, but also as to use as a tool for my personal projects. I am proud to say that I am a Champion Mentor with WRDC where we help make STEM careers more relatable for young girls/women. The website I created is to help all high school students find their way, but is sponsered by WRDC as the resource does focus on the growing tech industry. I have loved technology from childhood; I remember coding my 'cool' graphics into my piczo website using HTML when I was 14. Being a Software Instructor now exemplifies that my passion for technology is alive and well.</p>

	        <p>I would love to be a part of the Get Coding program not only because of the positive reputation the program has gained in the community, but also for the potential that it will give me when I look to transfer fully into the technology industry. Creating this website has been a fun experience, and this is just the beginning. The possibilities are numerous once you're equipped with the knowledge that this program can give you.</p>
